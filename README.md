Sure, Imma need as much help as I can get doing this so if you have notes, take a look in main.json as to how you need to format adding a heading, and then make a PR
# Can has use as API?
yh, but I'm not gonna explain how cause I ain't promoting stealing my database (particularly if you're a corporation). And also there's a console log that alerts anyone who's remotely curious that you're using my database and search system
